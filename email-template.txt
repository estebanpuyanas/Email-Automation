Dear {recipient_name},

I hope you are well. My name is Esteban Puyana, and I’m a third-year student at Northeastern University, pursuing a combined degree in Computer Science and Philosophy. Additionally, at Northeastern, I am part of the university’s chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, a member of the Chess and Squash clubs A-teams, and I host a weekly radio show in WRBB.

This past fall semester I completed my first Co-Op experience, where I worked as a data architecture engineer for an international hotel management firm from August through December. This upcoming summer, I will be interning at Maine-based biotech company EnviroLogix, working as a software engineer.

Due to Northeastern’s Co-Op program, I am allowed to take every other semester off from classes and partake in a full-time Co-Op that can last anywhere from 4-8 months. Given that I already have a summer internship, I am looking to do a fall Co-op/internship right after my summer internship with EnviroLogix.

I am reaching out to see if you would be willing to take a few minutes to connect regarding my interest in {company}. I recently applied for a {position} at {company} and I would love to connect with you to learn more about your experience with the company, and how I can position myself as a strong candidate in the application process. Your perspective would be incredibly valuable as I navigate the recruiting process. Please let me know if that would be possible. I am flexible and would be happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
